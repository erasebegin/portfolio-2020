          I have undertaken large projects that have pushed me to the very
          limits of my understanding of programming languages as well as
          business and design concepts. This year I have worked on my biggest

          . Whilst I was confident that I could create a good-looking and
          performant blog and portfolio, I had never set up a CMS for a client
          before and didn't know the first thing about e-commerce. Nevertheless
          I worked tirelessly to understand everything I needed for a successful
          implementation. As it stands the client is extremely satisfied with
          the result and makes regular use of the platform I have provided them.

          on various platforms as well as share samples. Using a combination of
          client assets and self-created assets I went from design to finished
          product in less than 2 days and had another very satisfied customer.

          As well as ambitious coding projects I have also taken on a large
          illustration project for Juxt, a company that is rolling out a
          bi-temporal database product called Crux. I was comissioned to create

            illustrations for the Crux tutorial website

          to make it more engaging for users. I developed the concept that each
          stage of the tutorial should be represented by a different planet. The
          process from concept to final design was a monumental undertaking that
          pushed me to the limits of my capabilities. I have come out of the
          other side much more capable and confident in my ability as an
          illustrator.

          One of the most wonderful aspects (and perhaps the fundamental aspect)
          of programming is being able to create tools to solve problems. I was
          delighted when I reached a level of proficiency where I could go from
          having an idea to making it a reality.

          Having spent so much time teaching online, I was forced to write ten

          Shortly after that I was having a free-talk class with one of my
          students and thought it would be a great idea to teach her Scrabble.
          So I found a random number generator, we assigned numbers to letters,
          and would use the number generator to "draw" from the "bag" of
          letters. But there were some big problems. Firstly this didn't follow
          the Scrabble letter distribution so we kept ending up with a handful
          of consonants. Secondly there was no system to track which letters had
          been used and when we'd used up all the letters. So of course{" "}

            target="_blank"

          >
            I built it myself
          </a>
          ! This is still a gem of a classroom tool that allows me to use
          nothing but the classroom platform to play Scrabble. It would be super
          useful in real classrooms that have a blackboard too!

          But there are still so many things I want to make and I definitely
          need server-side scripting to implement fully functioning
          applications. So I have embarked on a journey in to Node JS, the most
          recent accomplishment of which is{" "}

          Even from my earliest projects I liked to keep things light-hearted
          and make things that are as fun to experience as they are to build.
          While I was learning basic front-end development over on
          Freecodecamp.org I was tasked with{" "}

            creating a product landing page
          </a>
          . So I went all-in making illustrations and writing detailed
          descriptions of the company and their products. The graphics are all
          (digitally) hand-drawn and I couldn't be prouder of the results.

          entertained while I wrestled with the CSS grid.
